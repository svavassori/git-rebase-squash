this if is shared between branches
update with care!



This file should be handled
with very care becasue it is
shared between all branches.

This means that the probability
of collision is higher with
respect to other file that aren't
shared between branches or that
aren't modified in two concurrent
branches.

So the bottom line is:

!! - PAY ATTENTION - !!
